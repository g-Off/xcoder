# xcoder

A simple command line tool for sorting and syncing an Xcode project file.

* Groups can be sorted (recursively if desired) either alphabetically or by type.
* Groups can be synchronized (recursively if desired) with their on disk folder. This will add new files and folders and delete ones that are no longer present.

## Installation

The preferred installation method uses [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint). Then all that is required is running the following command in your terminal.

```shell
 mint run g-Off/xcoder
 ```
